This is my 1st Data Analysis project in Excel using pivot tables and charts to create an interactive dashboard.

While executing this project, I learned and used Data Cleaning, Data Processing, Data Analysis and Data Visualization.

**Objective:** Vrinda store (an hypothetical online store) wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, they can understand their customers and increase sales in 2023.

**Sample Key Questions:**

* Compare the sales and orders using a single chart.
* Which month got the highest sales and orders?
* Who purchased more in 2022, Men or Women?
* What are the different order status in 2022?
* List the top 10 states contributing to the sales?
* Relation between age and gender based on number of orders.
* Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
* Which is the highest selling category?

**Insights**:

* March has the highest sales (~1.9M) and orders (~2800)
* Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%)
* Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states (~35%)
* Adult age group (30-49 years) is contributing in maximum orders (~50%)
* Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are contributing to maximum sales (~80%)

**Action Point:** Target marketing campaigns to women customers of age group (30-49 years) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads of offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.

Thanks for your guidance Rishabh Mishra.
